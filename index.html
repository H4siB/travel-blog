            <br>
            When I think of paradise on Earth, I think of the Bahamas. It’s got everything you could want in a tropical getaway and then some! Beautiful views, crystal clear turquoise waters, white sand as soft as a blanket, beach resorts where are all of your problems will seemingly melt away, and even beaches with pigs.
            <br><br>
            How can you top that?!
            <br><br>
            With over 700 islands, there’s an island for every traveler out there. Whether you’re looking to sip Bahama Mamas the entire time or you want to explore the country from the ocean floors, there’s an adventure at every turn in the Bahamas.

            <b style="color: purple;">Best Time to Visit~</b>
            <br>
            The best time to visit the Bahamas is during the peak season, which runs from December to April. Though the weather is practically perfect every season, the islands do lie within the hurricane belt, so it’s best to avoid them between June and November.
            <br><br>
            Nothing like a hurricane to ruin your vacation. 
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, because the weather is perfect in during winter and spring, hordes of tourists make their way to the Bahamas. Prices for hotels and flights are higher, and the beaches are filled with people.
            <br><br>
            Luckily the waves crashing against the white sand beaches with the sun make it all worthwhile.

            <b style="color:teal;">What To Expect~</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>Language</b>: English is the official language of the Bahamas and is spoken by a majority of the population.
            <br><br>
            <b>Currency</b>: The official currency of the Bahamas is the Bahamian Dollar (BSD). 1 USD is equivalent to 1 BSD. This exchange rate makes everything extremely to understand, and you won’t have to worry about doing too much math.
            <br><br>
            <b>Credit Cards & ATMs</b>: Credit cards are widely accepted at many restaurants, large shops, and hotels, though it all depends on the location. The same holds true for ATMs. On larger islands such as New Providence Island and Paradise, you will have no trouble finding an ATM. If you’re visiting the Out Islands, you might struggle to find an ATM so you’ll want to make arrangements before you arrive.
            <br><br>
            <b>Plugs</b>: On the Bahamas, the plugs are type A and B, the standard voltage is 120 V, and the standard frequency is 60 Hz. If visiting from the states, you won’t need an adapter or converter. I recommend buying a universal adapter (make sure it has surge protection) and using a converter for hairdryers and hot tools.
            <br><br>
            <b>Safety</b>: Because the Bahamas is comprised of over 700 islands, it’s hard to say if the country is safe as a whole. It all varies on the island. For example, Nassau has been known for armed robberies and theft towards tourists. Yet on the Out Islands, this criminal activity is seen far less. To avoid becoming a victim of crime, exercise caution, and watch over any valuables you have with you.

                <li><b>Cutters</b>: A cutter is a Bajan sandwich made with salt bread, a slightly dense and chewy roll, filled with meats such as flying fish, ham or cheese. The most famous version is the flying fish cutter, served with lettuce, tomato and pepper sauce for an extra kick.</li>
